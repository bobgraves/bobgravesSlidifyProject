Developing Linear Models for Fuel Enconomy Analysis
========================================================

A Shiny Application for you to try...

About the Application
========================================================

This application performs Miles per Gallon (mpg) Analysis of mtcars Data Set by created a variety of linear models, based on terms selected by the user. 

- Interactive, click-and-Go! operation using Shiny
- Plots of model fit 
- Dynamically handles models with one or more terms
- Display linear model function to the user
- Based on mtcars data set
- Available today on shinyapps.io and GitHub

How it Works - The Code
========================================================
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(UsingR)

data(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl  <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$vs   <- factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
mtcars$am   <- factor(mtcars$am,labels=c("Automatic","Manual"))

```
The application is based on Shiny, so it has a ui.R and server.R files. The code takes user checkbox selection(s) which get sent to the server.R looking like this example:
```{r echo=FALSE}
a<-c("am ", "wt ")
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
print(a)
```
Then, the code builds the formula and computes the linear regression model (fit):
```{r}
if(length(a)>0) {
    terms<-paste(a,collapse='+')
    f<-paste("mpg ~ ",terms)
    }
l<-paste("lm (",f,", data=mtcars)")
fit<<-lm(formula = as.formula(f), data=mtcars)
```
Sample Plot of Linear Model Fit
========================================================
Linear Model: `r l`
```{r, echo=FALSE}
    par(mfrow=c(2,2))
    plot(fit)
```

========================================================
The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).
