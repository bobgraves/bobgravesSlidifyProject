Developing Linear Models for Fuel Enconomy Analysis
========================================================

A Shiny Application for you to try...

About the Application
========================================================

This application performs Miles per Gallon (mpg) Analysis of mtcars Data Set by creating a variety of linear models, based on terms selected by the user. 

- Interactive, click-and-Go! operation using Shiny
- Plots of model fit 
- Dynamically handles models with one or more terms
- Displays linear model function to the user
- Based on mtcars data set
- Available today on shinyapps.io and GitHub

How it Works - The Code
========================================================

The application is based on Shiny, so it has ui.R and server.R files. The code takes user checkbox selection(s) which get sent to the server.R looking like this example:


```
[1] "am " "wt "
```
Then, the server builds the formula and computes the linear regression model (fit):

```r
if(length(a)>0) {
    terms<-paste(a,collapse='+')
    f<-paste("mpg ~ ",terms)
    }
l<-paste("lm (",f,", data=mtcars)")
fit<<-lm(formula = as.formula(f), data=mtcars)
```
Sample Plot of Linear Model Fit
========================================================
Sample Linear Model: lm ( mpg ~  am +wt  , data=mtcars)

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).
